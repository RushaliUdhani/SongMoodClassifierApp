Machine Learning Model to Classify Mood of Songs

This application is being created for K3G Music Enterprises, it is a new music station that is planning to enable listeners to listen to music based on how they feel. We planned to use Machine learning to classify songs for this purpose. Acknowledging there are new songs added to their catalog on a daily basis, they intend to build a machine learning based classifier service which would classify songs as (Happy/Sad). In order to test feasibility, they wanted us to be able to build a classifier that would classify “any” Hindi song as Happy/Sad.
